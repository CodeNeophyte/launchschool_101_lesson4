On your own ideas

Below are some extra ideas you may want to explore on your own. They're too
challenging and out of scope for this course, but may be worth exploring for
the adventurous programmer.

1. Minimax algorithm
You can build an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe by utilizing the minimax algorithm.

2. Bigger board
What happens if the board is 5x5 instead of 3x3? What about a 9x9 board?

3. More players
When you have a bigger board, you can perhaps add more than 2 players. Would it
be interesting to play against 2 computers? What about 2 human players against
a computer?
